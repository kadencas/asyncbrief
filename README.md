Thanks for checking out AsyncBrief

This is Kaden's final project for Northeastern's CS5340: Human Computer Interaction

The goal of this project is to act as a 'Smart Proejct Management Dashboard'. What initially started off as a static, AI summary/daily standup delivered via email,
the application is now more interactive and will continue to become even more interactive. 

We are aiming to add:

auto-generated timeline, 
more robust action items list that persist in database, 
fine tuning the AI thru the front end
